# odin-admin-dashboard

The final project for the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The goal is to make a dashboard based on
this design:

Though the instructions then say

>You donâ€™t have to make a pixel perfect match with the design example. Consider this an opportunity to practice your CSS
>skills with your own designs.

So I had a bit of fun with the users and colors.
